Cited instances where we could have seen this coming. Broke down the structure of the relationship. And you went to bed only after I was feeling much better. Which I was. That was the catharsis I required. To logically break down everything and make it make sense. Thank you for being there for me at my lowest. And also being a very good friend there after.
